## Accessibility of Information and Data Posted in HydroServer

HydroServer uses access control policies and procedures to manage access to content according to the access control settings created by users. All information, data, metadata, photos, and other content posted or stored in HydroServer is potentially available to other HydroServer users and the public. You are responsible for determining who has access to the content you upload to HydroServer. Utah State University disclaims any responsibility for the preservation of confidentiality of such information.

HydroServer users can choose to share at the following levels of granularity:

**Access to monitoring site metadata:** You can choose to share monitoring site metadata with individual HydroServer users by adding them as a site owner, or you can set a site’s privacy to “public”. When a site is set to public access, all site descriptive metadata is viewable by the public, and the site appears in the overall “Browse Monitoring Sites Page”.
Access to datastream metadata: You can choose to hide or share metadata about each individual datastream that has been created at an individual monitoring site. Choosing the option to share datastream metadata makes it visible to the public. Site owners always have access to datastream metadata.
**Access to datastream data:** You can choose to hide or share the data values of each individual datastream that has been created at an individual monitoring site. Choosing the option to share datastream data makes that data visible to the public. Site owners always have access to datastream data values.

## Media

If you upload images to HydroServer, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Users can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

## User Profile Information

User profile information placed in HydroServer is public and potentially accessible to all HydroServer users. We encourage you to provide user profile information to sufficiently identify your data, the responsible organization, and to ensure that prospective consumers of your data can contact you. However, do not add information to your user profile that you want to keep private. We will strive to protect your email address by, for example only allowing registered users access to “mailto” links, but cannot guarantee that your email address will not be exposed.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, this Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time at our sole discretion. Utah State University encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to the Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
